// Run takes an exclusive, non-blocking lock on a state directory for the
// duration of a run, and returns its release.
//
// Two `dawn run` processes against one --dir corrupt nothing: journal lines are
// atomic O_APPEND writes and blobs are content-addressed, so the log stays
// readable and every ref stays valid. They simply both MISS the same key, both
// execute it, and both pay. That is the failure this prevents — silent double
// token spend, which is exactly what an overnight cron does when a run overruns
// its own interval and the next one starts on top of it. Nothing in the output
// would tell you; the journal just has two lines where you expected one.
//
// flock, not a pid file: the kernel drops it when the process dies, so a run
// killed with SIGKILL leaves nothing to clean up and there is no stale-lock
// heuristic to get wrong. It is also why the lock file's CONTENTS are never read.
//
// `dawn show` never takes it. Reading committed state is always safe, and a
// preview that blocked on a running job would be its own 3am annoyance.

// this function returned nil, so the guarantee above simply did not hold and
// nothing said so.
